    <h2>next: html5</h2>


    <p>
        A human language like English, with its vocabulary of a million words, can’t express every nuance of thought unambiguously, so with only 100 or so words that we can use in
        HTML, there will be situations when it’s not clear-cut which element to use for which piece of content. In that case, choose one; be consistent across the site.

        ost people are aware that HTML5 gives us many new elements to describe parts of a Web page, such as header, footer, nav, section, article, aside and so on. These exist
        because we Web developers actually wanted such semantics. How did the authors of the HTML5 specification know this? Because in 2005 Google analyzed 1 billion pages to see
        what authors were using as class names on divs and other elements. More recently, in 2008, Opera MAMA analyzed 3 million URLs to see the top class names and top IDs used in
        the wild. These analyses revealed that authors wanted to mark up these areas of the page but had no elements to do so, other than the humble and generic div, to which they
        then added descriptive classes and IDs.
