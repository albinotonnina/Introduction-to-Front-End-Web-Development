    <p>HTML documents should only focus on the structure of the document</p>

    <p>An HTML document should not describe how to visually present content, but only describe its contentâ€™s structural semantics or meaning.</p>

    Eliminating presentation-oriented markup and writing semantic HTML markup has a variety of important advantages:
    Maintainability. Semantic markup is easier to update and change than web pages that contain a great deal of presentation markup.
    Faster. Semantic web pages are typically quicker to author and faster to download.
    Accessibility. Visiting a web page using voice reading software can be a very frustrating experience if the site does not use semantic markup.
    Search engine optimization. Semantic markup provides better instructions for search engines: it tells them what things are important content on the site.
